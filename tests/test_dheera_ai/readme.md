# Testing for `dheera_ai/` 

This directory 1:1 maps the the `dheera_ai/` directory, and can only contain mocked tests. 

The point of this is to:
1. Increase test coverage of `dheera_ai/`
2. Make it easy for contributors to add tests for the `dheera_ai/` package and easily run tests without needing LLM API keys.
